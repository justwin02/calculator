This repository contains a comprehensive calculator application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML provides the structural layout, while the CSS adds aesthetic enhancements. The JavaScript enables fundamental mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It incorporates event listeners for both mouse and keyboard interactions, ensuring a seamless user experience. Robust error-handling functions are implemented to prevent issues such as division by zero and exceeding value limits, fostering user-friendliness and efficiency.
